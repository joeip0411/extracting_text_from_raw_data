# Extracting text from raw data / Generating features from text data
Text documents, such as crawled web data, are usually comprised of topically coherent text data, which within each topically coherent data, one would expect that the word usage
demonstrates more consistent lexical distributions than that across data-set. A linear partition of texts into topic segments can be used for text analysis tasks, such as passage retrieval in IR (information retrieval), document summarization, recommender systems, and learning-to-rank methods.

This project touches the very first step of analyzing textual data, i.e., extracting data from semi-structured text files, i.e. html and pdf. The extracted text will then be processed and relevant features are generated from machine learning purposes.
